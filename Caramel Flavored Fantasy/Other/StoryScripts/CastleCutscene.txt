Zedrul say That you will soon rule the world.
Zedrul say The castles of Starfall will be yours, and their lords will bow to you. Their people will call you master.
Vaush look down
Vaush say Yes. Good. This is what I want. Are you sure? Your magic is not wrong?
Zedrul look down
Zedrul say My magic is never wrong. But the prophecy does not come without a cost. There is always a price for the power I grant.

Vaush look right
Vaush say Yes. There is always a price with you, wizard. Just like before, with the girl.
Zedrul look left
Zedrul say I require a boy this time. From the village near Gaz. His blood will awaken the dragon.
Vaush say Then we will find him. Take my dark riders. You must go with them, to identify that he is the one.
Zedrul say Your majesty. I will bring him to you.
